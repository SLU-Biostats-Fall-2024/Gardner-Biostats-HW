### Introduction

The objective of this assignment is to have you continue practicing the skills you have learned in Chapters 3 and 4 of Getting Started with R and reinforce the ideas we discussed in class regarding the Weissgerber et al. paper. Please complete all of the following steps:

1.  Write the code to set up your workspace.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

2.  Read in the dataset called soil_data.csv and name it "soil."

```{r}
soil <- read.csv(here("data", "soil_data.csv"))
```

3.  Create a histogram for the SOM_percent column in the dataframe. Accept the default number of bins.

```{r}
ggplot(soil, aes(x=SOM_percent)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

How would you describe the mean_SOM data based on viewing the histogram? Write your answer below:

Skewed right

4.  Create a new dataframe called SOM by calculating for each forest the mean soil organic matter and the standard deviation of soil organic matter. Make sure to name variables you create "mean_SOM" and "sd_SOM" so that the next code chunk I give you works.

Summarize N

```{r}
nit <- soil |>
  group_by(Forest) |> 
  summarize(mean_nit = mean(Nitrate_N_ppm, na.rm = T),
            sd_nit = sd(Nitrate_N_ppm, na.rm = T))
```

```{r}
SOM <- soil |>
  group_by(Forest) |> 
  summarize(mean_SOM = mean(SOM_percent), sd_SOM = sd(SOM_percent))
  
```

5.  Now run the following code chunk which will create a bar plot of mean soil organic matter per forest, with standard deviation as error bars.

```{r}
ggplot(SOM, aes(Forest, mean_SOM))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = mean_SOM + sd_SOM, ymin = mean_SOM - sd_SOM), width = 0.2)+
  geom_col(fill = "white", color = "black")+
  ylab("Mean percent soil organic matter")+
  xlab("Forest name")
```

Based on what you see in the bar chart, how would you describe the pattern of SOM between the 4 different forests? Write your answer here:

The SOM looks much higher in the Kip Tract than the other forests.

Now create a boxplot of the SOM_percent data. Use Forest as the x-axis variable and overlay the point data on top of the boxplot. Make the points blue and somewhat transparent. Call the x-axis "Forest name" and the y-axis "Percent soil organic matter" (hint: See homework 18...).

```{r}
ggplot(soil, aes(x = Forest, y = SOM_percent)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red") + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) + 
  ylab("Percent soil organic matter") + 
  xlab("Forest name")

```

Based on what you see in the box plot, write out your answers the following questions:

-   how would you describe the pattern of SOM between the 4 different forests?

    I would say that the Kip tract has the most variability and the highest average SOM. Then Donnerville and South Hammond are pretty similar and Degrasse is has the lowest SOM.

-   What do you notice that is different from how the data were displayed in the bar plot?

    The box plot includes the maximum and the minimum values for each forest type, and shows a bit that Donnerville has a bit of a higher mean than South Hammond.

-   Which plot type is more informative? Explain your answer.

    The box plot is more informative because it includes more information like the minimum and maximum as well as the interquartile range values to show the distribution and variance of the data better.
